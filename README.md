## The steps to Create Project:
### Step-1:
    Install Nodejs in the system to run the React Application
    Install Bootstrap
### Step-2:
    Create React Project using following command
        npx create-react-app react_app_name
### Step-3:
    Navigate to project folder using following command
        cd react_app_name
        
    Install MDB Package for styling using following command
        npm i mdb-react-ui-kit
        
    Install npm i Font Awesome using following command
        npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
        
    Add below import statement in index.js file to import these packages
        import 'mdb-react-ui-kit/dist/css/mdb.min.css';
        import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css";
        
    Add Robo font to to the page by add the following into the head of index.html file
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
        
    Add following to the index.css file to add font style
        body {
          font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        
    Now write the code for the web pages 
### Step-4:
    After completing the reactjs code we must test the code on web browser
    
    Start the mongodb server using the following command
        mongod
        
    Start the Springboot Server that we have created in the Task 1 
        (ie. https://github.com/pravinkumarmahato/Task-1-Java-REST-API-example)
        
    Run the react app in seperate terminal using the following command
        cd project_directory
        npm start
        
    Now you can access the react web app from the link generated by the npm

### Step-5:
    Create a github repository
### Step-6:
    In the Github repository go to Actions search for Node.js click on configure of first one edit yml file according to the project and click commit
### Step-7:
    Now it will create a CI-CD workflow in the Github Action of the repository
  
    Add the following steps in the workflow:
        - Checkout
        - Setup nodejs
        - Install mdb (Bootstrap)
        - Install fontawesome
        - Install Dependencies
        - Build app
        - Test app
        - Deploy the app to gh-pages
        - Setup QEMU
        - Setup Docker Buildx
        - Login to Docker Hub
        - Build and push Docker Image to Docker Hub
    
      Now whenever we do some change and push the code to Github Action,it will Integrate and Deploy the Code Automaticaly to the github pages.
      Then it will build docker image and push the docker image to the docker hub.
### Step-8:
      To Deploy the Project on the github pages go to Settings > Pages > Branch select the Branch in which the code of the project pushed and click save
      It will deploy the project an display the url of the deployed project.
